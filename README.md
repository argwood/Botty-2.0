<p align="center">A sassy but smart Discord bot for Pok&eacute;mon GO</p>

Originally developed by me in 2017 for the [DTC Chicago Pok&eacute;mon GO Discord](https://discord.gg/sSeeGPs), Botty has provided thousands of users with pertinent Pok&eacute;mon knowledge on a daily basis. With Botty-2.0, Pok&eacute;mon GO fans outside of Chicago can have access to Botty's numerous features without those pesky DTC-specific details previously included. Completely rewritten from the original version, Botty-2.0 is now faster and smarter, and users are now able to toggle the DTC-specific functions on and off at will for maximum flexibility. 

To host Botty-2.0 from your own machine, you'll need the following:
* Python3 (Python3.5.3 or higher is required for Discord.py versions above v1.0. I use Python3.6)
* Discord.py version 1.4.1 or similar (`pip3 install discord.py==1.4.1` to install a specific version)
* A valid bot token (Steps 2-4 of [this guide](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/) are particularly helpful) 

To run:
* `export TOKEN='my_bot_token_here'`
* `python3.6 start_botty.py`

To use:
* Type `!help` in any channel in your server for a full list of features
