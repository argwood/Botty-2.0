<p align="center">A sassy but smart Discord bot for Pok&eacute;mon GO</p>

Originally developed by me in 2017 for the [DTC Chicago Pok&eacute;mon GO Discord](https://discord.gg/sSeeGPs), Botty has provided thousands of users with pertinent Pok&eacute;mon knowledge on a daily basis. With Botty-Lite, Pok&eacute;mon GO fans outside of Chicago can have access to Botty's numerous features without those pesky DTC-specific details previously included.
